This app is a game where you can practice the multiple tables

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Create a layout in Swift UI
- Manipulate the State and render layout elements
- Conditional rendering
- Create Form Sections, Stepper, TextField, Button

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)

This code is made as part of this [challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/3/3/challenge)
